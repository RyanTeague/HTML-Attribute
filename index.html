    <!--HTML Attributes
    
        HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
    -->

    <!--HTML Attribute
    
        . all HTML elements can have attributes
        . Attributes probide additional information about elements
        . Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        . Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like name="vaue"
    -->

    <!--The href Attribute
    
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of 
        the page the link goes to
    -->
    <h2>The href Attribute</h2>

    <p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. THe link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>

    <a href="http://www.google.com">Visit Google.com</a>

    <hr>
    <!--The src Attribute
    
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. the src
        attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
    -->

    <h2>The src Attribute</h2>
    <p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>

    <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
    <hr>

    <!--There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute
    
        1. Absoulte URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another
        website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

        NOTE, External  images might be under copyright. If you  do not get 
        permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, 
        you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here,
        the URL does not inclued the domian name. If the URL begins without a 
        slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If
        the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the momain. Example
            src="images/img_girl.jpg".
        
        Tip, It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you
        change domain.
    -->

    <!--The width and height Attributes
    
        The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes,
        which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)

        <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
    -->

    <!--The alt Attribute
    
        The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifeis an alternate text for
        an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due
        to a slow connection, or an error in the scr attribute, or if the user uses a 
        screen reader.
        
        img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in jacket"
            see what happens if we try to dispaly an image that does not exist:
            img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket"
    -->

    <!--The Style Attribute
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, fornt,
    size, and more.
    -->

    <h2>The style Attribute</h2>
    <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>

    <p style="color: red;">This  is a red paragraph.</p>
    <hr>

    <!--The lang Attribute
    
        You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to
        declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines
        and browsers.

        The Following Example specifies English as the language
            !DOCTYPE html
            html lang="en"
            body
                .
            /body
            /html
        
        Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang
        attribute. So, the first Two Characters define define the language of the HMTL page,
        and the last two characters define the country.

        The Following Example specifies English as the language and United States as the country
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="US">
            <body>
                .
            </body>
            </html>
    -->

    <!--The title Attribute
    
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse
        over the element
    -->

    <h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>

    <p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over the paragraph, to diplay the title attribute as a tooltip</p>
    <hr>

    <!--Always Use Lowercase Attribute
    
        The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

        The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercaseor
        lowervase like tilte or TITLE.
    -->

    <!--Always Wuote Attribute values
    
        The HTML standard does not require quotes arround attribute values.

        Good
            <a href="https://www.w3school.com/html/">Visit the HTML tutorial</a>

        Bad
            <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit the HTML tutorial</a>
        
        Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will bot display the tiltle 
        attribute correctly, because it contains a space
    -->

    <h1>About W3Schools</h1>
    <p title=About W3Schools>You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains space</p>

    <p><b>
        if you move the mouse over the paragraph above, your browser will only display the first word from the title
    </b></p>
    <hr>

    <!--Single or Double Qoutes?
    
        Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but
        single quotes can also be used.

        In some situtations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it
        is necessary to use single quotes:
    -->

    <h2>Single or Double Quotes</h2>
    <p>In some situtations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:</p>    <p>Move your mouse over the paragraphs below to see the effects:</p>

    <p title='john "ShotGun" Nelson'>With a double quote title</p>
    <!--or vice versa-->
    <p title="John 'shotgun' Nelson">With a single qoute title</p>
